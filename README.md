### About
This repository contains my university coursework project for the Data Visualisation module.
The main goal of this project was creating 4 charts in R that all discuss the same topic and 
contibute some extra knowledge to the subject. I've decided to create visualisations on UK's
progress towards reaching the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The dataset
I've selected for this project was the World Bank Open Data, as it contains lots of open source
data on greenhouse gas emissions.
### Charts and Explanation
I've selected 3 different metrics from the World Bank data to track the UK's progress on 2015
Paris Agreement goal - **Greenhouse Gas emissions**, **CO2 emissions** and **percentage of energy production
from renewable energy**. When creating the visualisations I've followed the 
[ASSERT](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/ASSERT-Model-for-Visualization_fig1_228460802) framework for
creating visualisations. Whilst creating the charts I've also considered accessibility, and this is
why charts use colour-blind friendly colour palette.
